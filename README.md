# Personal web page

Source code of my personal website where I write who I am and my skills. In the future I'll showcase some of my personal projects.

It uses [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) because it is easy to learn, has support for multiple languages and generates a static site currently hosted [here](https://paula-svzaq.ondigitalocean.app/).

## How to run it

You need to have

- [Node 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

In the root directory where `package.json` is.

- Run `yarn install`.
- Then run `yarn docs:dev`.

You should now have the project running.

If you want to build it to deploy somewhere run `yarn docs:build`
